Like New","Only had for less than a week.No scratches or dents. Looks new. Battery was 100% and 1 cycle. Did have to take it to Verizon because of the eSIM. Which is fine. Sound, camera, and display are great. Very happy so far.  Will update if something comes up further in"

Like new",This is a refurbished iPhone 15 at a very good price. Have had it for over a month now and works like new. Excellent battery life (the reason I gave up on my iPhone X).  The eSIM mad it pretty straightforward to activate on Mint Mobile.

Good Phone",Everything came good no scratches no dents no smudges. Definitely worth getting and even came with a free privacy screen protector which is even a bonus.

Took some patience","the phone looks great. The only issue was A LOT of back and forth with my carrier to get it to work. I do feel this was mainly on my carrier, but still an unpleasant experience that resulted in me having NO SERVICE for a few days while the eSIM import kept failing.I was able to eventually get it to work after spending probably a total of 4-5 hours on it. Ultimately, probably not worth the money I saved"

Good business","I waited till now, after the people I bought the phones for gave me their feedback, to give mine. First of all, the shipment was very fast! There was a good and professional communication between us,  but most importantly, these phones are high end quality üëå. I bought 3 all together and they function pretty good all along (from battery life to camera, to the screen). I would recommend it to everyone asap."

Excellent Condition","My hesitation to buy this IPhone from Amazon‚Äôs renewed program was  unwarranted. The phone arrived in excellent condition. The battery charged to 100%, showed 6 cycles and there were no bumps, bruises or knots that indicated hard use or wear and tear‚Äîjust a barely noticeable nick on the screen. . Transferring data from my 11Pro to the 15 was fast and easy. The only challenge I experienced was installing the ESim card and my carrier helped with that.  So far, I haven‚Äôt experienced problems with the applications I use most often.  My tablet and watch connected easily and I have twice the capacity of my old phone. After reading about the renew program, I felt much safer than going through other Marketplaces where there is no guarantee for the product you purchase.Winning!"

ESP Review - Producto es exactamente lo descrito","El tel√©fono es exactamente lo descrito, adquir√≠ la versi√≥n en estado excelente y nada que decir, el estado del tel√©fono se ve√≠a inmaculado, estado de la bater√≠a al 100% con 19 ciclos de uso, talvez no como salido se fabrica pero pr√°cticamente nuevo.Todas las funciones intactas, n√∫mero de serie revisado en la p√°gina de Apple en el cual pude verificar la originalidad del tel√©fono (nada de bootlegs o copias chinas).√önicamente a tomar en cuenta que debido a que es un dispositivo proveniente de USA opera con eSIM, por si planean comprar desde fuera del territorio o envi√°rselo a un familiar para cerciorarse de poder realizar este cambio si usan SIM f√≠sico."

Came in great condition!","Just like new. Very happy with my purchase. Only thing I‚Äôll say is that it was sent with the wrong charger. Sent a lightening cable instead of usbc. I didn‚Äôt mine, I had plenty of usbc cables but that might not be great for someone who doesn‚Äôt have them. Otherwise, the phone is great and working like a charm."

Just came in - Two minor scratches","Upon receiving my product, it came with two small scratches on the screen. It Doesn't look like its impeding anything, so i would say this was a score. It came in fast, and overall, its cheaper than buying new. I would purchase this way again."

Glad I got the iPhone 15 as is pretty much new and still had 6 months warranty from Apple",Phone looks new and was easy to transfer (Metro PCS).

Although I know I paid about $20 or so for fast shipping the phone was still delivered late. The phone colors is pretty.

A tiny scratch on the screen",Overall is good. But a tiny scratch on the screen. Not sure whether this worth $200 price down.

Got stuck on black screen when in DND mode","Mine had a software glitch where the phone screen wouldn‚Äôt turn on if the phone was charging and in DND mode.  Even when you unplug it, the screen wouldn‚Äôt turn on and would stay black.  It took 10-30 mins for it to decide to turn back on.  Pressing buttons does nothing because the phone thinks its display is on, and I‚Äôm left with an album full of screen shots of my Lock Screen from my trying to turn it on.  This should not be happening in a brand new phone, I am so aggravated."

Not worth the price",I paid $100 less than the original price.  I had to go through Amazon to save some money. The phone was described as Excellent condition. But no it wasn‚Äôt. The outside body looks great but the charging port was damaged to the point where you can only use the charger cable on one side. You can clearly see stain in it. They sent me a very cheap old fashioned charging cable with a usb charging box. Which you can get both for as low as $10. The package was also very cheap. Not satisfied!

Don't waste your money!",Phone does not always ring for incoming calls.Camera does not work at times....must turn phone completely off and back on to get camera to function.Have had this phone gone over at ATT.  Many years of dealing with Amazon and first problem encountered.  Problem not with Amazon but with seller!
